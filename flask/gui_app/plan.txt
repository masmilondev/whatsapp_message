Sending whatsapp message
init app

need:
    - file link
    - A = name
    - B = number

What we want:
we have two files
    - customer
    - abandoned
    - Filter contact from customer by filter condition
    - Make all condition separate worksheet, so user can see all contact by worksheet
    - when sending message, and if its customer, user can select worksheet and send message

remove duplicates from its.
open excel file
    way to remove duplicate:
        make a dictionary
        add contacts to dictionary by
            key = mobile number
            value = full row
            save all contact to same worksheet. remove old worksheet and add new worksheet with new contacts.

Whenever we want to send message, keep the contact to "messages" worksheet mannually
